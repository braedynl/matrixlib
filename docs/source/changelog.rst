Changelog

Version 0.3.0
-------------

This version is considered to be the first "real" version of the library, as most of the API underwent many large, fundamental changes in structure. We *do not* anticipate further changes of this magnitude, as we believe that we've settled on a solid foundation.

Earlier Versions
----------------

We *highly* discourage the use of earlier versions, as version 0.3.0 introduces monumental changes in pretty much everything fundamental to the library. We've effectively wiped the signature of these prior versions from documentation to prevent their use.
