Matrices-Py
===========

Simplistic, lightweight vectors and matrices for Python 3.

This library aims to be a "natural" extension to the core Python tool set, similar to the `fractions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html>`_ module of the standard library. Most everything contained within is, and will always be, written in Python alone.

Getting Started
---------------

This project is available through `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ (requires Python 3.9 or later):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install matrices-py

.. warning::

    Matrices-Py is currently in its infancy, and may see future changes that are not always backwards compatible.
